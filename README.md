# Regression-kNN-and-DecisionTrees
In this repository, we will be using k-NN for Regression and Decision Trees Regression for regression purpose. We will be comparing mean squared error for both and will be choosing the best algorithm among them with best tree depth and umber of nearest neighbours.
